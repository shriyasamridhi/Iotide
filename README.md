oTide ‚Äì Underwater Aquatic Life and Debris Detection!üêü

A smart blend of AI, IoT, and sustainability, this project aims to monitor aquatic ecosystems in real time.

Key Highlights:

Live image recognition of aquatic life and underwater debris on a video streamed and recorded by ESP32-CAM

Built using ESP32-CAM and a custom-trained PyTorch ML model

Monitoring water quality using a TDS sensor

Enhanced underwater visibility using image preprocessing

Goal: Conserve marine biodiversity by detecting trash and marine life

Why it matters:
IoTide contributes to cleaner water bodies and smarter aquatic conservation using scalable and affordable tech.

Keen to explore collaboration, mentorship, or scaling opportunities!
